# ML_ZeroTo100
My personal machine learning journey from 0 to 100 — notes, notebooks, and practice projects.
---

## 🧩 Topics Covered (Ongoing)
- **Python for ML** – NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Math for ML** – Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability  
- **ML Foundations** – Supervised, Unsupervised learning  
- **Algorithms** – Regression, Classification, Clustering, Decision Trees  
- **Model Evaluation** – Metrics, Bias-Variance, Cross-validation  
- **Deep Learning (Coming Soon)** – Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs  
- **Projects** – Real-world datasets, EDA, and model building  

---

## 🧠 Goal
To build a **solid foundation in Machine Learning** by combining theory, coding, and projects — and gradually transition toward **AI/ML applications** and **research-level understanding**.
